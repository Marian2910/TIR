	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most popular technologies of the modern era for providing on-demand services to the end users. Most of the computing tasks in cloud data centers are performed by geodistributed data centers which may consume a hefty amount of energy for their operations. However, the usage of renewable energy resources with appropriate server selection and consolidation can mitigate the energy related issues in cloud environment. Hence, in this paper, we propose a renewable energy-aware multi-indexed job classiﬁcation and scheduling scheme using container as-a-service for data centers sustainability. In the proposed scheme, incoming workloads from different devices are transferred to the data center which has sufﬁcient amount of renewable energy available with it. For this purpose, a renewable energybased host selection and container consolidation scheme is also designed. The proposed scheme has been evaluated using Google workload traces. The results obtained prove 15\%, 28\%, and 10.55\% higher energy savings in comparison to the existing schemes of its category.},

	abstract = {By effectively virtualizing operating systems and encapsulating necessary runtime contexts of software components and services, container technologies can significantly improve portability and efficiency for distributed application deployment. It flexibly extends virtual machine based cloud (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) as a much lighter virtual environment (container cluster) for agile application management. However, existing container management systems are not capable of handling concurrent requests efficiently, particularly for the underlying clusters with heterogeneous machines and the requested containers with multi-resource demands. In this paper, we propose an Enhanced Container Scheduler ({ECSched}) for efficiently scheduling concurrent container requests on heterogeneous clusters with multi-resource constraints. We formulate the container scheduling problem as a minimum cost flow problem ({MCFP}), and represent the container requirements using a specific graph data structure (flow network). {ECSched} affords flexibility in constructing the flow network based on a batch of concurrent requests, and performs the {MCFP} algorithm to schedule the concurrent requests in an online manner. We evaluate {ECSched} in different testbed clusters, and measure the scheduling overhead with large-scale simulations. The experimental results show that {ECSched} outperforms state-of-the-art container schedulers in container performance and resource efficiency, and only introduces a small and acceptable scheduling overhead in large-scale clusters.},

	abstract = {Container technology has become a new trend in both the software industry and cloud computing. Containers support the fast development of web applications and they have the potential to reduce energy consumption in data centers. Containers are usually first allocated to virtual machines ({VMs}) and {VMs} are allocated to physical machines. The container allocation is a challenging task which involves a two-level allocation problem. Current research overly simplifies the container allocation into a one-level allocation problem and uses simple rule-based approaches to solve the problem. As a result, resource is not allocated efficiently which leads to high energy consumption. This paper provides a novel definition of the two-level container allocation problem. Then, we develop a hybrid approach using genetic programming hyper-heuristics combined with human-designed rules to solve the problem. The experiments show that our hybrid approach is able to significantly reduce energy consumption than solely using human-designed rules.},

This paper focuses on improving the energy efﬁciency of servers for this new deployment model by proposing a framework that consolidates containers on virtual machines. We ﬁrst formally present the container consolidation problem and then we compare a number of algorithms and evaluate their performance against metrics such as energy consumption, Service Level Agreement violations, average container migrations rate, and average number of created virtual machines. Our proposed framework and algorithms can be utilized in a private cloud to minimize energy consumption, or alternatively in a public cloud to minimize the total number of hours the virtual machines leased.},

The analysis shows that the average Power Usage Effectiveness ({PUE}) of the facilities participating in the programme is declining year after year.

Brownout provides a promising direction to avoid overloads through configuring applications to temporarily degrade user experience. Additionally, brownout can also be applied to reduce data center energy consumption. As a complementary option for Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling and {VM} consolidation, our combined brownout approach reduces energy consumption through selectively and dynamically deactivating application optional components, which can also be applied to self-contained microservices. The results show that our approach can save more than 20\% energy consumption and there are trade-offs between energy saving and discount offered to users.},

In nature, the proposed approach firstly predicts the resource utilization of the upcoming period based on the Gaussian process regression method. Subsequently, the convex optimization technique is engaged to compute an appropriate quantity of physical servers for each monitoring window. This quantity of interest is calculated to ensure that a minimum number of servers can still provide an acceptable quality of service. Finally, a corresponding migrating instruction is issued to stack the virtual machines and turn off the idle physical servers to achieve the objective of energy savings. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we conduct the experiments using synthetic data from 29-day period of Google traces and real workload from the Montage open-source toolkit.

We present a host states prediction mode based on Naive Bayesian classifier for {SLA}-aware and energy-efficient consolidation of {VMs} in cloud data centers. Different from other future resource utilization prediction methods, our proposed method predict the future host states instead.
